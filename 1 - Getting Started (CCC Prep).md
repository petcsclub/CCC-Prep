## Instructions

The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is an fun programming contest for high school students hosted by the University of Waterloo every February.
This guide is intended for people who are new to the CCC. It will tell you what you need to know about the contest, and help you practice.

### 0: What is the CCC, anyways?

The CCC is a fun **programming contest** that takes place every year in February.  
There are two divisions available: Junior and Senior. You may only compete in 1 division each year.  
Each division has **5 different problems** of increasing difficulty.  
Each problem is worth 15 points, for a total maximum possible score of 75 points.  
You will have **3 hours** to try and get as many points as possible!  
You can use many different programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++.  
Check out the official [CEMC Website](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html) (Resource #1) for more information.  

We highly recommend you participate in the CCC - it's fun way to test your programming and problem-solving skills!  
If you're interested, we suggest you join the **CCC Google Classroom** (wu44s6) for registration details.

### 1: Okay, so how do I write the actual contest?

The CCC is written online using the [CCC Online Grader](https://cccgrader.com/) (Resource #2).  
We suggest that you register an account and practice using the grader at least once before the contest. Check the CCC Google Classroom for how to do this.  

During the contest, you will need someplace to write code!  
If you have your own computer and know exactly what language you'll want to use, you can install and use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  
Otherwise, you can just use [repl.it](https://repl.it/) (Resource #4) to write and test your code.

### 2: I want more practice!

Is the CCC Grader too much of a hassle? There are many other sites that you can use to practice solving problems!
One popular site is the [Don Mills Online Judge (DMOJ)](https://dmoj.ca/) (Resource #3).  
(There are others, of course, but this is the main one that we'll be using.)  
DMOJ has all the problems from past CCCs, as well as a bunch of other fun problems that you can solve.
If you're new to DMOJ, we suggest you register an account and start by solving an easy problem like [Hello, World!](https://dmoj.ca/problem/helloworld) or [A Plus B](https://dmoj.ca/problem/aplusb).  
You should probably write and test your code on [repl.it](https://repl.it/) or in an IDE before submitting it to the judge.  

If you're still not entirely comfortable with any programming languages, we suggest you check out these [slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwEvHekjxLwTNUd3SDA2c2J4alE) (Resource #5) made by PETCS alumni - they'll help you get started with C++.

### 3: DMOJ is fun!

If you've already finished solving the problems from Part 2, we suggest you try some of the following problems:  

+ [CCC '05 J1 - The Cell Sell](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc05j1)
+ [CCC '07 J1 - Who is in the Middle?](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc07j1)
+ [CCC '07 J2 - I Speak TXTMSG](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc07j2)
+ [CCC '14 J1 - Triangle Times](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc14j1)
+ [Past CCC J1 Problems](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?search=J1&category=4)
+ [Past CCC J2 Problems](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?search=J2&category=4)
+ [Past CCC J3 Problems](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?search=J3&category=4)  
+ [DMOPC '14 Contest 1 P2 - Tiles](https://dmoj.ca/problem/dmopc14c1p2)
+ [TLE '16 Contest 2 P1 - In Debt](https://dmoj.ca/problem/tle16c2p1)

You can also use the filters on DMOJ to search for more problems!
